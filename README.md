# entertainment_center

This is my submission as Project 1 of Udacity's back end developer course. This file will create an HTML document, open your default web browser, and display 8 of my favorite movies in an engaging interface. Upon clicking any of the movie tiles, its trailer will play.

This project demonstrates a use of Bootstrap, jQuery, and CSS to create an engaging UI.
